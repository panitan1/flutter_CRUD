# Flutter_CRUD (◡‿◡✿)

My Project: PHP, SQL, and Flutter Integration
This project connects a PHP backend with an SQL database, while using Flutter for the frontend. It supports full CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete—on the data.

Backend: PHP handles server-side logic and interacts with the SQL database.
Frontend: Flutter is used to build the mobile app interface with a smooth user experience.
SQL Database: Data is stored and managed in an SQL database, with operations performed through PHP.
